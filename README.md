# Morse Code
Morse Code is a Python script that can decode messages from morse code, and translate binary messages into morse code. Morse code uses dots and dashes to encode messages. Binary involves patterns of zeros and ones. I created this as part of Kenzie Academy's software engineering program. The included tests provided by Kenzie Academy staff can be run to prove that the script and translator I made work.

# Test
```python
python -m unittest discover tests
```
